The environment is a Linux container? The repository is likely a codebase. The user wants to see the contents of that directory. We need to explore the file system. The path is absolute Windows path. In the container, we may not have that path. We need to explore the file system to locate that path. The instructions: \"When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\"\n\nThus we need to explore the file system. Use execute_bash to list directories. However, the path is Windows style. In Linux, the path might be under /mnt/c/Users/jesse/Documents/dev if using WSL. But we are in a container environment. The repository root is /workspace. The user asks \"What do you see at `C:\\Users\\jesse\\Documents\\dev` ?\" Possibly they want to list the contents of that directory. We need to check if that path exists. Use `ls -R` or `find`. Let's try to see if that path exists. Use `execute_bash` with `ls -R` or `find`. But we need to be careful: the path may not exist. We can try `ls -l /mnt/c/Users/jesse/Documents/dev` or `ls -l \"C:\\Users\\jesse\\Documents\\dev\"` but in Linux, backslashes are escape characters. We can try `ls -l /c/Users/jesse/Documents/dev`? Not sure.\n\nBetter approach: Use `find` to locate any directory named \"dev\" under /workspace or root. But the path is Windows style, maybe the repository includes a folder named \"C:\\Users\\jesse\\Documents\\dev\"? Unlikely. Could be a Windows path in a config file. But the user asks \"What do you see at `C:\\Users\\jesse\\Documents\\dev` ?\" So we need to list the contents of that directory. Let's try to see if that path exists in the container. Use `execute_bash` with `ls -la` on that path. In Linux, we can try `ls -la /mnt/c/Users/jesse/Documents/dev`. If not, we can try `ls -la /c/Users/jesse/Documents/dev`. Or we can try `ls -la /Users/jesse/Documents/dev`. But we need to explore.\n\nFirst, let's list root directories: `ls -R /` maybe too large. Let's start with `ls -la /` to see top-level. Then we can see if any mount points. Use `df -h` maybe.\n\nBut the user wants to see the contents of that path. So we need to try to locate it.

For commands that need to run for a specific duration, you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a powershell command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one powershell command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The powershell command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one powershell command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a powershell command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional. Sets a hard timeout in seconds for the command execution. If not provided, the command will use the default soft timeout behavior.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: think ----\nDescription: Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.\n\nCommon use cases:\n1. When exploring a repository and discovering the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.\n2. After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.\n3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.\n4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.\nParameters:\n  (1) thought (string, required): The thought to log.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: finish ----\nDescription: Signals the completion of the current task or conversation.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- You have successfully completed the user's requested task\n- You cannot proceed further due to technical limitations or missing information\n\nThe message should include:\n- A clear summary of actions taken and their results\n- Any next steps for the user\n- Explanation if you're unable to complete the task\n- Any follow-up questions if more information is needed\n\nThe task_completed field should be set to True if you believed you have completed the task, and False otherwise.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) message (string, required): Final message to send to the user\n  (2) task_completed (string, required): Whether you have completed the task.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`, `partial`]\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #4: execute_ipython_cell ----\nDescription: Run a cell of Python code in an IPython environment.\n* The assistant should define variables and import packages before using them.\n* The variable defined in the IPython environment will not be available outside the IPython environment (e.g., in terminal).\n\nParameters:\n  (1) code (string, required): The Python code to execute. Supports magic commands like %pip.\n---- END FUNCTION #4 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #5: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #5 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!
